# after running the test network:
#you can check the docker:

#to see the ledger size you to enter to the following:

# then go to:
cd /var/hyperledger/production/


# then you can list the folder and thier sizes:

#some important information to run the explorer correctly
we have to delete the organization folder and copy it after running the fabric network:
  sudo cp -r /home/moh/go/src/github.com/mohammedt.pal@gmail.com/fabric-samples/test-network/organizations /home/moh/explorer
  sudo chmod -R 777 organizations
the we have to update the content of test-network.json file which located in (./explorer/connection-profile/test-network.json):
  "adminPrivateKey": 
				"path": "/tmp/crypto/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp/keystore/XXXXXXX
#replace XXXXX with the correct file name 
&&&
"peers": ["peer0.org1.example.com"],
			"signedCert": {
				"path": "/tmp/crypto/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp/signcerts/cert.pem"

# make sure that cert.pem is the same name in the path or correct it


--*************************************************************************************************************************
after more than 7 days of trying to run the explorer the problem that prevents the explorer for accessing mychannel was:
--*************************************************************************************************************************
 the "wallet" directory typically contains files related to the identities and credentials used by Explorer to interact with the blockchain network.
 If there's an issue with invalid signing identities, clearing this wallet directory can help resolve it.
 and to solve it you have to enter the wallet of the (explorer.mynetwork.com) and delete it content using the following:
      docker exec -it explorer.mynetwork.com sh
      cd /opt/explorer/wallet
      rm -rf /opt/explorer/wallet/*

      then we have to clear the explorer and run it again:
        docker-compose down
        sudo docker-compose up --build
